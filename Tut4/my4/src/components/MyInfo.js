            I'm learning React. This app/site is written by me from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is interesting how curious about React and JavaScript I am!
            In next few months, I plan to write an app, that gonna be advanced, dynamic. 
            I wish someon could use this app for learning new things.
